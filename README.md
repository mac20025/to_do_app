# Overview

A simple project that connects Python to a Firebase database that stores
tasks in a to do list.

I've created this software to demonstrate how to use Python to connect to a cloud database.

# Development Environment

For this software, I used:
- Visual Studio Code 1.91.1
- Python 3.10
- firebase_admin
- pyrebase

# The project has 3 files:
- fb_authentication.py: Contains the code that will authenticate the user
- fb_operations.py: Stores the functions that handle database operations
- mains.py: Gets the program running
